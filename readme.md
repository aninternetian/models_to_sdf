## Example

Artist exports models with textures

Folder name: "HospitalModel"
Folder contents:
- model.dae or model.obj
- model.jpg or model.png

## What this setup will do

1. Script moves the following:
- copies the contents into the dropbox folder
- move the contents into a created "meshes" folder (inside the original "HospitalModel" folder)

2. Script manipulates the following:
- model.config
- model.sdf
